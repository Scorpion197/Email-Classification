# Email-Classification
It's very easy to build a ML model which works well on training data, but is it the case for test data?
This project is done for learning purposes. It aims to test a ML model on real Gmail emails \n to evaluate it's accuracy. We first build the model and then we extract
our "NORMAL" emails from our inbox and then we feed the built model with them to know if he gonna classify them as spams (which means our model is bad) or normal
(which mean our model is very good). If you want you can run the same test on your spam inbox.
# Installing the requirements
You can install the tools with the command: 
``` pip install scikit-learn pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk ```
# Testing Your emails
To test your emails just run the code in jupyter notebook and write your email as a text.
